# Neo4j
For my Discrete Math project, I used Neo4j to build a book review and order system with graph databases. It featured nodes for books, reviews, discounts, and shippers, with relationships enabling insights like average ratings and discount totals. This deepened my understanding of graph theory in real-world systems.
